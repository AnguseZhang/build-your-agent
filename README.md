# **build-your-agent**

An open project initiated by the DeepModeling community focused on constructing intelligent agents for scientific research. 

We continuously release and share a collection of agent samples that are oriented towards real scientific research problems, to help developers understand practical agent architecture design and construction methods. These examples aim to span both user-friendly instructions and multiple cutting-edge application scenarios.


Our recent goals include:
- Define and validate a reference architecture for “scientific research agents”  
  *(Perception → Planning → Execution → Feedback)*
- Build sample agents for typical scientific scenarios:  
  - Domain-Specific Research Assistant: Retrieve and summarize literature based on keywords, and automatically generate review drafts
  - Materials Design Optimization Agent: Structure generation → Simulation calculation → Performance evaluation → Structure screening
  - Drug Molecule Screening Agent: Molecule filtering and optimization process based on multiple drug-likeness properties
  - Omics Data Intelligent Analysis Agent: Integrate cross-domain data and tools to automatically complete result analysis
  - More ideas are welcome!
- Provide agent development guides and tutorial notebooks
- Support common agent frameworks: ADK / Camel / LangChain / Autogen
